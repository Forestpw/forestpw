# Hello, I'm Forest 👋

I am a developer with four years of experience and have spent a good amount of time building integrations for large brands primarily using PHP and Rust. More recently I have been working in web development using Java, React, and Spring but would say I spend most of my time on the backend. Outside of programming I love anime, videogames, or spending time with my animals 🏳️‍🌈
